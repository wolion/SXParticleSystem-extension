Drag both .h and .m Files to youre Sparrow Project

Be sure, that the SXParticleSystem is allready in the project

Now you can use the copy method to copy an existing SXPArticleSystem to a new
one without loading the .pex file again.

Because all variables are properties now you can change the particles as you wish
at runtime.
